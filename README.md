# zoom-mute-button
I used $1 hardware button and ESP32 microcontroller with Arduito program to make it mute my mic during calls in Zoom. It connects to my Macbook via bluetooth. It also have an additional small button to leave meetings. Both commands works in MacOS, Windows requires some adjustments in the program (to update Zoom hotkeys which are OS specific).

I will add a circuit diagram of the hardware part a bit later (if my wife be so kind to draw them)
